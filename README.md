# Car Race Game

A simple car racing game built using Python and the Pygame library. This game demonstrates how to create a basic game loop, handle user inputs, and implement game states such as pausing and restarting.

## Features
- Basic movement controls for the player's car.
- Collision detection with enemy cars.
- Scorekeeping and level progression based on time survived.
- Pausing and resuming the game.
- Intro screen and instructions.
- Game over with the option to restart or quit.

## Installation

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (if you haven't already).
2. Install the Pygame library using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-race-game.git
    cd car-race-game
    ```

4. Ensure the required image and sound files (`player_carsmwh.PNG`, `enemy_car1smwh.PNG`, `enemy_car2smwh.PNG`, etc.) are in the same directory as the script.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python car_race_game.py
    ```

2. The game will start with an intro screen:
   - Press **START** to begin the game.
   - Press **INSTRUCTION** to view the instructions.
   - Press **QUIT** to exit the game.

3. During the game:
   - Use the arrow keys to control the movement of your car.
   - Avoid colliding with enemy cars.
   - Press `P` to pause the game.

4. The game ends when your car collides with an enemy. You can restart the game or return to the main menu.

## Controls
